## Modern LLM Architecture Deep Dive

A comprehensive look at how modern language models are built, focusing on architectural decisions and their implications.

### Key Components

1. **Attention Mechanisms**
   - Multi-head attention
   - Flash attention optimizations
   - Memory efficient implementations

2. **Position Embeddings**
   - Rotary position embeddings
   - ALiBi
   - Relative position representations

### Implementation Details

```python
class TransformerBlock:
    def __init__(self, dim, heads):
        self.attention = MultiHeadAttention(dim, heads)
        self.feed_forward = FeedForward(dim)
        self.layer_norm1 = LayerNorm(dim)
        self.layer_norm2 = LayerNorm(dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        # Self-attention with residual connection
        x = x + self.attention(self.layer_norm1(x))
        # Feed-forward with residual connection
        x = x + self.feed_forward(self.layer_norm2(x))
        return x
```
