## The Challenge of Cross-Language Code Translation

In today's polyglot programming world, translating code between languages is a common but complex challenge. Here's how I built XCode2YCode to tackle this problem using state-of-the-art LLMs and modern software architecture.

## Architecture Overview

XCode2YCode uses a three-tier architecture:
1. **Frontend**: React-based interface for code input/output
2. **Backend API**: FastAPI server handling requests
3. **AI Engine**: LangChain-powered translation core

## Key Technical Decisions

### Why LangChain?
- Robust prompt management
- Built-in memory systems
- Easy integration with multiple LLM providers

### FastAPI Benefits
- Async support for better performance
- Automatic API documentation
- Type safety with Pydantic

## Implementation Challenges

The biggest hurdles were:
1. Maintaining code structure
2. Handling language-specific idioms
3. Optimizing for performance
