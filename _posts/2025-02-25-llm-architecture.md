## Modern LLM Architecture Deep Dive

A comprehensive look at how modern language models are built, focusing on architectural decisions and their implications.

### Key Components

1. **Attention Mechanisms**
   - Multi-head attention
   - Flash attention optimizations
   - Memory efficient implementations

2. **Position Embeddings**
   - Rotary position embeddings
   - ALiBi
   - Relative position representations
