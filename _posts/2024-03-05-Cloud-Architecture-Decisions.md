## Choosing the Right Cloud Provider for AI Workloads

When deploying AI applications, choosing the right cloud provider is crucial. Here's my analysis based on recent projects:

### AWS Advantages
- More mature ML infrastructure
- Better pricing for large-scale deployments
- Extensive ecosystem integration

### GCP Strengths
- Superior AI/ML tooling
- Better GPU availability
- More flexible pricing models

### Real-world Comparison
```python
# AWS SageMaker Deployment
import sagemaker
from sagemaker import ModelPredictor

predictor = ModelPredictor(
    endpoint_name="my-endpoint",
    sagemaker_session=sagemaker.Session()
)

# GCP Vertex AI Deployment
from google.cloud import aiplatform

endpoint = aiplatform.Endpoint(
    endpoint_name="my-endpoint"
)
```
