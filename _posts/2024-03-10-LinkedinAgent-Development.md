## Why Build a LinkedIn Automation Tool?

The job search process can be overwhelming. LinkedinAgent was born from my own experience of spending hours on repetitive LinkedIn tasks. Here's how I automated it.

## Technical Architecture

The system comprises:
1. **Selenium-based Scraper**: For data collection
2. **MongoDB Backend**: For data storage
3. **Analytics Engine**: For insights generation

## Key Features

1. **Profile Optimization**
   - Keyword analysis
   - Content suggestions
   - Network recommendations

2. **Application Automation**
   - Smart filtering
   - Auto-apply capabilities
   - Follow-up tracking
